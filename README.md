# EthWallet
The inspiration for this project was the desire to create a mobile cryptocurrency wallet. 
After exploring the different libraries and available platforms, I designed and built an Ether wallet using Android Studio.
This application utilizes the web3j library for connection to the Ethereum network, as well as Infura for access to an Ethereum node.
At this point the project is "complete" but at some point in the future I may return and implement new features.
